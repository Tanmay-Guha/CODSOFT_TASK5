# 🔐 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high precision and recall.

## 🎯 Goal
Detect rare and suspicious transaction patterns while handling heavy class imbalance.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- SMOTE (imbalanced-learn), SHAP (model interpretability)

## 🔍 Process
- Data preprocessing & normalization
- Class imbalance handling (SMOTE)
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score

## 📊 Results
- Recall: 99.2%
- Precision: 85.6%
- F1-score: 0.92

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Precision-recall tradeoff is more useful than accuracy
- SHAP helped explain model predictions
